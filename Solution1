This class contains various methods for manipulating arrays (such as sorting and searching). 
This class also contains a static factory that allows arrays to be viewed as lists.The methods 
in this class all throw a NullPointerException, if the specified array reference is null, except where noted.
This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

import java.util.Arrays;

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       
    int[] a1 = {6,9,14,20};
    
    int index = Arrays.binarySearch(a1,9);
    System.out.println("Index:" +index);
    
    System.out.println("----->-------->--------->");
    
     int[] a2 = {6,22,9,14,3,20,2,89,23};
     
     Arrays.sort(a2);
     for(int i: a2){
     System.out.println(i +" ");
     }
     
    }
}

// All the operations occurs in O(logn)
